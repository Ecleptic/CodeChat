### CodeChat  
CodeChat is a collaborative learning project intended to bring new coders into contact with people who can answer their questions. 

- [x] Currently hosted at www.codechat.me

We are currently allowing registration and chat, however there is no persistent code execution for the time being.


## Why CodeChat?
- Have you ever asked a question on help forums only to get answers that don't work?
- Have you ever experienced the snarky attitudes that seem to permeate most code-help sites?
- Are you tired of unhelpful communities that seem to exist to make themselves feel better while not actually being helpful?

# CodeChat aims to solve those problems!

CodeChat is a web application build with React (Facebook, Instagram) that supports in-line code execution to foster a collaborative learning environment.
